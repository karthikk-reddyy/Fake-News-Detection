📰 Fake News Detection


This project builds a Fake News Detection System using machine learning techniques to classify news articles as Fake or Real. The entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

🔍 Project Overview


✔️ Features


Reads and combines real and fake news datasets

Preprocesses and cleans the data

Vectorizes text using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer

Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)

Classifies news articles as Fake or Real

Provides a testing section with manual inputs

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Workflow Summary


Data Loading: Loads fake and real news data from CSV files.

Data Cleaning: Drops irrelevant columns (title, subject, date).

Preprocessing: Merges and shuffles the data.

Splitting: Divides data into training and testing sets.

Vectorization: Converts text data to numeric format.

Model Training: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier (or similar).

Evaluation: Tests the model's accuracy.

Manual Testing: Provides a section to manually input and test predictions.
